                ZTrade works as a store application for newer operating systems, for older versions Windows and MacOS or for Linux distributions
                it can run with Java.<br><br>
                Store applications have significant security and functionality advantages while offering the user a single simple
                 how to install, update, open and uninstall for all apps in this category. <br><br>
                 Among others, they are controlled by and distributed by the manufacturers of the operating system (like Microsoft, Apple, Google),
                 since their rights have been limited to those that are functionally necessary (internet connection as a customer, printing, etc.).<br><br>
                 Both the desktop and mobile versions have exactly the same features and functionality. <br><br>
                 The only difference is the number of windows that can be displayed at the same time and how they are organized.<br><br>

                <br><br>
                &middot; Each version and change of the application is submitted to the operating system manufacturer for review.

                <br><br>
                &middot; When running it runs inside a security shell that allows it to access only the declared resources.
                <br><br>
                In some operating systems with high user protection this is the only way to install applications.<br>
                 The old way of installing apps from any location carries significant risks as there is no auditing mechanism in place
                 for the applications' potential access to your personal information, they do not operate under a security shell and have access to all files and computer resources.<br>
                 While the application may have been corrupted in the storage location or during your communication with the site.

                    The most important rules in Fundamental analysis from a user's point of view are:
                     Stock price growth over the long term must be supported by sales growth.
                     Profit growth must be supported by sales growth.
                     As a result, it is advisable to trade stocks with positive revenue (sales) changes by checking the % Change in 1 Year Revenue .
                     (the most recent four quarter sales versus the prior year correspond) and the 3-year Change in Revenue
                     (the last twelve-thirds sales compared to the previous year correspond).<br></h3>

                    In this order we enter the price limit for our order (Price field) as in the orders with a Price limit, and the activation price of the order in the Stop Price field. The Stop Price is an instruction to the system to wait until the stock price reaches the Stop Price
                     which we gave and then to enter an order with a Price Limit into the system.<br><br>
                     If it is a Sell order the current price of the Share must be above the Stop price (vice versa for a Buy order).
                     Stop order is useful to limit our losses.<br><br>
                     Suppose we have acquired a stock at a price of 10, the current price of the stock is 9.8 and we do not want to lose more than 1, we should put a Sell Stop order with a limit of Price 9 and Stop Price 9.10. This means if the stock falls to 9.10 or below, our sell will be triggered at 9. We have made sure that the Stop Price is somewhat higher than the Ask Price, depending on the liquidity of the stock, so that when our order is triggered there are buyers at this price.
